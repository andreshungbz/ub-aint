# ub-aint

This is a repository of various coding activities and assessments that I have done for the courses in the Associate's in Information Technology [AINT] program at the University of Belize from the year 2023 to 2025. 

ub-aint acts as a history of my progress in my decision to study Information Technology. It also serves as a resource that other students may use as study/help material.
